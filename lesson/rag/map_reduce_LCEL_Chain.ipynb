They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me . . .\"\\n\"What must I do, to tame you?\" asked the little prince.\\n\"You must be very patient,\" replied the fox. \"First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .\"\\nThe next day the little prince came back.\\n\"It would have been better to come back at the same hour,\" said the fox. \"If, for example, you come at four o\\'clock in the afternoon, then at three o\\'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o\\'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am!

There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards.

You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.\"\\nThe little prince went away, to look again at the roses. \"You are not at all like my rose,\" he said. \"As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.\" And the roses were very much embarassed.\\n\"You are beautiful, but you are empty,\" he went on. \"One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you--the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.\\nAnd he went back to meet the fox.\\n\"Goodbye,\" he said.\\n\"Goodbye,\" said the fox. \"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\"\\n\"What is essential is invisible to the eye,\" the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.\\n\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\"\\n\"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--\" said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.', metadata={'source': './file/little_prince.txt'}), Document(page_content='\"I am looking for men,\" said the little prince. \"What does that mean-- \\'tame\\'?\"\\n\"Men,\" said the fox. \"They have guns, and they hunt.

All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you.

They all looked like his flower. \"Who are you?\" he demanded, thunderstruck. \"We are roses,\" the roses said. And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden! \"She would be very much annoyed,\" he said to himself, \"if she should see that . . .

A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees--and one of them perhaps extinct forever . . . That doesn\\'t make me a very great prince . . .\"\\nAnd he lay down in the grass and cried.\\n21\\nIt was then that the fox appeared. \"Good morning,\" said the fox. \"Good morning,\" the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing. \"I am right here,\" the voice said, \"under the apple tree.\"\\n\"Who are you?\" asked the little prince, and added, \"You are very pretty to look at.\"\\n\"I am a fox,\" the fox said. \"Come and play with me,\" proposed the little prince. \"I am so unhappy.\" \"I cannot play with you,\" the fox said. \"I am not tamed.\" \"Ah!
